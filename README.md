## Part 1: WeatherPy

In this deliverable, using citipy and OpenWeatherMap API, weather data was retrieved for analysis of varying factors: Temp, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed. Comparing these factors with a city latitudes, scatterplots with a linear regression line were created to visualize the different relationships. The analysis of the relationships are in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Part 2: VacationPy

In this deliverable, using geoViews and Geoapify API, a map of ideal vacation spots was created. In particular, the parameters set up for the vacation spots were based on temperatures above 70F and 0 Cloudiness. Using the Geoapify API, hotels within cities that fit my parameters were identified and added to the dataframe.
